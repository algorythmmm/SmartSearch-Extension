#### Steps to create your Grok API key:

1. Visit the [Grok website](https://www.grok.com/) and create an account (if you don't have one).
2. After logging in, navigate to the **API** section to create a new API key.
3. For this extension, you will need to specify the model. In the example setup, the model is:  
   `model="mixtral-8x7b-32768"`.  
   This is one of the **open-source models** available from Grok.
4. Copy your API key and set it as an environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"


### 5. Use the Extension
